#### What is DeepRoute?

Itâ€™s a Flutter navigation package, it requires a minimal amount of code to generate everything
needed for navigation inside of your App. It has the advantage of not needing context, 
so you can navigate from your business logic also.

## Installing
Add DeepRoute to your pubspec.yaml file:

```dart
dependencies:
  deep_route:
```
Import DeepRoute in files that it will be used:
```dart
import 'package:deep_route/deep_route.dart';
```

## Usage

For sample code look in `/example` folder.

Step 1: Add "DeepMaterialApp" before your MaterialApp, use DeepMaterialApp instead of MaterialApp

```dart
void main() => runApp(DeepMaterialApp(home: Home()));
```
Step 2: Use DeepRoute for navigation like
```dart
DeepRouter.toNamed('/RouteName', arguments: 'sample');
DeepRouter.to(NextPage());
```

## Additional information

This package is in its early development stage.
